#+TITLE: README for Fast Forward Feature Selection
#+AUTHOR: Mathieu Fauvel
#+EMAIL: mathieu.fauvel@ensat.fr

* Objectives
  The  package provides  the python  codes to  perform a  fast forward
  feature selection using a Gaussian  Mixture Model.  The algorithm is
  based on the following papers  [] and [[http://fauvel.mathieu.free.fr/data/ffs_gmm.pdf][Nonlinear parsimonious feature
  selection for the classification of hyperspectral images]].

* Install
  Just download the  file ~npfs.py~ and import it with  python. It has
  been tested on linux, Debian Wheezy.

* Requirements
  Scipy needs  to be installed. For  a fast processing, a  good linear
  algebra library is required too. [[https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS][Openblas]] is a good option.

* Usage
